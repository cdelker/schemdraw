v0.6.0, 11-Feb-2020

    - Refactored internals to allow more control over individual components of drawing.
      Should have no effect unless the user is accessing internal attributes of the Element object.
      This also adds the `segments` list to the Element object, which allows finer control over 
      individual bits of the drawing.
    - Updated add_label so that "top" labels should always appear on top, regardless of flip/reverse
    - Swapped the direction of current sources, so that a current source with direction "up" has the
      arrow pointing up.
    - Added "zorder" parameter in the element definition dictionary and `add` method
    - Added `elements.ic` and `elements.multiplexer` functions as replacements to `blackbox` and `mux`.
      These include more functionality such as adjusting indiviudal pin rotation, color, and inverter bubbles.
    - Labels can be placed relative to an anchor position using the `add_label` method. This could be
      useful, for example, in labeling pin numbers on a logic gate or opamp.
    - Added new anchors to OPAMPs for power supply and offset nulls.      
        
    - New Elements:
        - MIC

          use import * with pylab; this suggestion will help avoid conflicts.
