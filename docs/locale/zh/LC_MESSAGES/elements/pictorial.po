"Pictorial Schematics use pictures, rather than symbols, to represent "
"circuit elements. Schemdraw provides a few common pictorial elements, and"
" more may be added by loading in :ref:`images`."

"The :py:class:`schemdraw.pictorial.pictorial.Breadboard` element has "
"anchors at each pin location. Anchor names for the center block of pins "
"use the column letter and row number, such as `A1` for the top left pin. "
"The power strip columns along each side are `L1_x` for the first column "
"on the left side or `L2_x`, for the second column on the left side, with "
"`x` designating the row number. Similarly, `R1_x` and `R2_x` designate "
"anchors on the right power strip columns. Note the \"missing\" rows in "
"the power strip columns, such as row 6, are not defined. Some examples "
"are shown below."

"Resistors and Diodes inherit from "
":py:class:`schemdraw.elements.Element2Term`, meaning they may be extended"
" to any length. Resistors take `value` and `tolerance` arguments used to "
"set the color bands. The colors will be the closest possible color code "
"using 3 bands to represent the value."

"Integrated circuits in DIP packages may be drawn with the "
":py:class:`schemdraw.pictorial.pictorial.DIP` element. The `npins` "

"The pictorial elements are drawn using solid shapes. As such, the "

" method will set only the color of the outline, if the Element has one. "

"The pictorial elements are designed with spacing so they fit together in "
"a breadboard with 0.1 inch spacing between pins. Some constants are "
"defined to assist in creating other pictorial elements: `pictorial.INCH` "
"and `pictorial.MILLIMETER` convert inches and millimeters to schemdraw's "
"drawing units. `pictorial.PINSPACING` is equal to 0.1 inch, the standard "
"spacing between breadboard and DIP pins."

"Schemdraw can import part files in the `Fritzing "
"<https://fritzing.org/>`_ format and use them in pictorial schematics. "
"Use :py:class:`schemdraw.pictorial.fritz.FritzingPart` and provide the "
"file name of an `.fzpz` or `.fzbz` part file. Schemdraw's anchors will be"
" set based on the part \"connectors\" defined in the part file. In this "
"example, a part is downloaded from the `Adafruit Fritzing Library "
"<https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library>`_ and used in a drawing."

msgid ""
"Note that occasionally anchor names defined in Fritzing parts are not "
"valid as Python identifiers, such as the `3.3V` anchor above, and "
"therefore cannot be used as attributes of the element instance (`f.3.3V` "
"doesn't work, obviously). In these cases, the anchor must be accessed "
"through the `absanchors` dictionary."
